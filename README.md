# Twemoji
Systemlessly replaces emoji font with Twemoji.

*Current Twemoji version: `June 4, 2017` ([source](https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font/releases))*

## Known incompatibilities
~~* Anything which will modify the system Emoji font file
* **May not apply correctly on certain OEM roms such as HTC!**~~
Unsure of above as they are for the EmojiOne module of which this is a fork to. Probably the same issues.

## Changes
* v1 - Initial release
